You can extend the VS Code editor itself through extensions. The VS Code community has built hundreds of useful extensions available on the VS Code Marketplace.

## Configure Visual Studio Code Extensions

Now that you're familiar with the Visual Studio Code user interface, our next step is to configure Visual Studio Code for C# coding.

1. Ensure that you have Visual Studio Code open.

    You can use the Windows Start menu to locate and open Visual Studio Code.

1. On the **Activity bar**, click **Extensions**.

    For those people who love keyboard shortcuts, you can also open the EXTENSIONS Side bar using the following key combination: Ctrl + Shift + X.

1. In the **Search Extensions in Marketplace** textbox, enter **C#**

    Entering "C#" will filter the list of extensions to show only the extensions that have something to do with C# coding. You can see that there's still a large number of extensions available to you.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Don't install extensions until you've determined that you actually need them. Like any Marketplace, many items perform similar functions and some items are quite specialized. You'll want to choose the extensions that provide the greatest benefit for the tasks that you need to complete rather than installing every extension that looks interesting.

1. In the filtered list of available extensions, click **C# for Visual Studio Code (powered by OmniSharp).**

    There's lots of information about the extension that you could read. For now though, the important thing to know is that this extension will help you to develop, edit, and debug C# code in Visual Studio Code. You can come back later to read about the extension if you want.

1. To install the extension, click **Install**.

    The Install button will change to Installing. This extension should install quickly.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you are interested in installing a spell checker, you might consider trying **Code Spell Checker** by Street Side Software. You can filter by "spell checker" to help you find it.

That's all of the extensions that you need for now.
