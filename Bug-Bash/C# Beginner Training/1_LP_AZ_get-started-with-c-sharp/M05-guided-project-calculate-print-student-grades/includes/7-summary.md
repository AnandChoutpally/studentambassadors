Our goal was to build an application that takes the assignment scores for students in a class, calculates their grade, and displays the results. 

To accomplish this, we declared and assigned values to variables of different data types, performed numeric operations, and used type casting to achieve accurate results. We also used the WriteLine() method and character escape sequences to format the output.

By breaking the problem down, we were able to build a solution using the skills we learned in the previous modules.
