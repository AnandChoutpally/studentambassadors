You'll be using the .NET Editor as your code development environment. You will be writing code that uses string and numeric variables, performs calculations, and displays results to a console.

## Project overview

You are developing a Student Grading application that automates the calculation of current grades for each student in a class. The parameters for your application are:

- You are given a short list of 4 students and their 5 assignment grades.
- Each assignment grade is expressed as an integer value, 0-100, where 100 represents 100% correct.
- Final scores are calculated as an average of the 5 assignment scores.
- Your application needs to perform basic math operations to calculate the final grades for each student.
- Your application needs to output/display each studentâ€™s name and final score.

Currently, the teachers grade book shows the graded assignments for each student as follows: 

```Output
Sophia: 93, 87, 98, 95, 100

Andrew: 80, 83, 82, 88, 85

Emma:   84, 96, 73, 85, 79

Logan:  90, 92, 98, 100, 97
```

The teacher requires that the calculated current overall grade for each student be displayed as follows:

```Output
Student     Grade
Sophia      94.6  A
Andrew      83.6  B
Emma        83.4  B
Logan       95.4  A
```

## Setup

Use the following steps to prepare for the Guided project exercises.

1. Open the .NET Editor coding environment.

1. Copy and paste the following code into the .NET Editor. These values represent the graded assignments for each student.

```c#
// initialize variables - graded assignments 
int currentAssignments = 5;

int sophia1 = 93;
int sophia2 = 87;
int sophia3 = 98;
int sophia4 = 95;
int sophia5 = 100;

int andrew1 = 80;
int andrew2 = 83;
int andrew3 = 82;
int andrew4 = 88;
int andrew5 = 85;

int emma1 = 84;
int emma2 = 96;
int emma3 = 73;
int emma4 = 85;
int emma5 = 79;

int logan1 = 90;
int logan2 = 92;
int logan3 = 98;
int logan4 = 100;
int logan5 = 97;
```

You are now ready to begin the Guided project exercises. Good luck!
