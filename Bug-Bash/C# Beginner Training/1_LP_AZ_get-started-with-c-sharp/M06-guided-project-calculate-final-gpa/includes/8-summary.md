Our goal was to build an application that takes course information for a student, calculates the overall GPA, and displays the results.

To accomplish this, we declared and assigned values to variables of different data types, performed numeric operations, and used type casting to achieve accurate results. We also used the WriteLine() method and character escape sequences to format the output.

Need help figuring out how to close this off :')
