Developers perform some tasks nearly every day. Tasks including declaring string and numeric variables, assigning and extracting values, and performing calculations are routine, but essential. Equally important is the task of communicating results to the application user. Mastering the ability to apply these skills to solve a given problem is something that every developer must learn to do.

## Example scenario

Suppose you are a teacher's assistant at a university. You've been tasked with developing an application that will help students calculate their GPA. The application will use the student's grades and credit hours taken to calculate their overall GPA. You are also provided a required format for reporting the student's GPA.

## What will we be doing?

This module will guide you through the steps required to develop your GPA Calculator application. Your code will declare and assign values to variables based on course information, perform various numeric calculations, and format and display the results. Calculations will include determining the sum of the grade points earned and total credit hours. To display the results in the required format, you will need to manipulate a decimal value to display a total of 3 digits. You will also use WriteLine() methods as well character escape sequences that help to format your results.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you will be able to write code that uses various variable types, performs numeric calculations, and displays formatted data for the user.
