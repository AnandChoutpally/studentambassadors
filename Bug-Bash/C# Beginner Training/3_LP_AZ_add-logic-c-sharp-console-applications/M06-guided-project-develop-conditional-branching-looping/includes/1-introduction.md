Applications often use a combination of branching and looping logic to control the order in which your code is executed. In addition, applications use data calculations and user interactions to influence the outcome of the Boolean expressions that control the execution paths. As the complexity of your applications grow, it becomes even more important to review your code and ensure that your variables are scoped at an appropriate level.

To achieve the design goals of your application, you'll need to mix and combine all the programming skills that you have learned.

## Example scenario

Suppose you're a developer who likes to support the local community. You and some of your friends started a business that helps find new homes for stray or abandoned cats and dogs. Your business started off small, with just a couple of strays, but it is starting to grow. You want to investigate creating an app that could help you to match the animals in your care with people who are looking for a new family pet. You have found that it's important to have a detailed description of the animals to share with potential owners. In addition, being able to describe the personality of the dog or cat makes them more appealing to potential new owners. You decide to create an app that will help you to manage the information about the cats and dogs that you have in your care.

## What will we be doing?

This module guides you through the process of developing the data-centric features of the Contoso Pets application. You will use selection and iteration statements to create sample data, list the descriptions of the animals in your care, and add new animals to the list of animals in your care. Throughout the application, you will use variables and expressions to direct the execution of your code through the branches that you've developed. You will also work to ensure that variables are scoped appropriately.

In short, the application will:

- add predefined sample data to the pets array
- iterate a "menu options and user selection" code block to establish the outer loop of your application
- implement code branches corresponding to the user's menu selections
- display all the information contained in the array used to store pet data (based on user's menu selection)
- iterate an "add new animal information" code block that enables the user to add one or more new animals to the pets array (based on user's menu selection)

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you will be able to develop code that combines selection and iteration statements to achieve your application design goals.
