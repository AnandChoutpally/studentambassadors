## Multiple Choice

A developer needs to capture a list of items from the user.  The user will enter the keyboard combination `ctrl + Esc` to exit.  Which is the best iteration statement for this purpose?
( ) foreach {{Incorrect. It's remotely possible to use the `foreach` statement for this purpose, but it wouldn't be straight forward.}}
(x) do-while {{Correct!  The `do-while` will allow the code to check each entry by the user until they enter the special keyboard combination to exit.}}
( ) while {{Incorrect. It's possible to use the `while` statement, but the `do-while` will allow the user to enter a value before the code begins checking for the special keyboard combination.}}
