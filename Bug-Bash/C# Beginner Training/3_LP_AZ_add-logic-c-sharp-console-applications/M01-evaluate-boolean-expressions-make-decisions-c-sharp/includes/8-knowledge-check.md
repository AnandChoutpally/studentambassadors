## Multiple Choice

A developer wants to compare two strings ignoring their case.  Which string helper method should the developer use?
( ) `Trim()`. {{Incorrect. The `Trim()` method won't help to ignore case when comparing strings.}}
( ) `Lower()`. {{Incorrect. `Lower()` isn't a method of the string class.}}
(x) `ToLower()`. {{Correct! The ToLower() method is used to convert text to lower case.}}

## Multiple Choice

Which line of code uses logical negation?
(x) `Console.WriteLine(!value);`. {{Correct! Adding the `!` operator (the "not-operator") before a conditional expression checks to ensure the expression is false.}}
( ) `Console.WriteLine(value != true);`. {{Incorrect. Evaluating that value isn't `true` isn't logical negation.}}
( ) `Console.WriteLine(value != false);`. {{Incorrect. Evaluating that value isn't `false` isn't logical negation.}}

## Multiple Choice

Which of the following lines of code is a valid use of the conditional operator?
(x) `int value = amount >= 10 ? 10 : 20;`. {{Correct! The syntax for a conditional operator is "? (value 1) : (value 2)".}}
( ) `int value = amount >= 10 : 10 ? 20;`. {{Incorrect. The conditional operator is reversed.}}
( ) `int value = amount >= 10 ? 10 | 20;`. {{Incorrect. The pipe character isn't correct for use in the conditional operator.}}
