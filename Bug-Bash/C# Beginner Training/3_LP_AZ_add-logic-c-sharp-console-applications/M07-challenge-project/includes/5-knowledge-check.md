## Multiple Choice

You are developing an application in Visual Studio Code. You save changes to your Program.cs file, and then run the `dotnet build` command in the Terminal panel. What information can you find in reported Error and Warning messages?
( ) one or more suggestions for how to fix any syntax issues detected {{Incorrect. Error and Warning messages do not include suggested fixes.}}
(x) the line number and information about what caused the error {{Correct. Error and Warning messages include a description of the issue and the line number where it occurs.}}
( ) links to help documentation {{Incorrect. Error and Warning messages do not include links to documentation.}}

## Multiple Choice

If you are going to create a iteration statement, under which condition is it better create a `while` statement rather than a `do` statement?
( ) when, prior to the iteration code block, your code doesn't know the values for the expression that will be evaluated by iteration statement {{Incorrect. A `do` statement would work well in this situation.}}
(x) when, prior to the iteration code block, your code does know the values for the expression that will be evaluated by iteration statement {{Correct. When your code is able to evaluate the loop expression prior to the loop, a `while` statement allows your code to implement 0 iterations.}}
( ) when you have an outer `do` or `while` loop and need to create one or more inner loops that use a `do` or `while` statement {{Incorrect. Nesting of loops is not a factor in this decision.}}
