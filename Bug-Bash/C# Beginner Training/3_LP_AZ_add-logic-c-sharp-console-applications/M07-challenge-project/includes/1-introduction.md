Challenge project - Extend the Contoso Pets app by adding new features

Challenge Project pattern:

- Introduction (includes the following H2 header sections)
    - Example scenario - fictional scenario for the app
    - What will we be doing? - bulleted list of high-level tasks (could align to the exercises)
    - What is the main goal? - describe the outcome of the guided project (describe what the app does)

- Prepare
    - Project specification
    - Setup

- Exercise units - (includes the following H2 header sections)
    - The first H2 is "Specification" that sets the goal without leading them through the solution.

        - Provide a functional specification for what this part of the project should do when complete.
        - Give the acceptance criteria (functionality, capacity, resilience, performance, etc.).
        - List the technologies they should use in this part.

    - The last H2 is "Check your work" and lets the user validate their solution.

        - Worked example (code in GitHub, completed document, etc.).
        - Sample input and expected output.
        - Rubric of criteria they can apply.
        - Video of an expert completing the project.

- Knowledge check
- Summary

When you develop an application, you often begin by developing the features that import or generate the data used by the application. Once your application has access to a dataset that supports the features of your application, or the means to create its own data, you're able to focus on the features that process data and generate reports.  

The features of the Contoso Pets application that are used to create the ourAnimals array data are nearly complete. The only task that remains is to ensure that the ourAnimals array data contains a complete dataset for each pet. A combination of selection and iteration statements will be needed to implement the new app features.

## Example scenario

Suppose you are one of the developers working on the Contoso Pets application. The application will be used to help you find new homes for pets that have been abandoned, or for cases when the owner cannot be located. The primary features of the application have been specified, and you and your friends have made good progress on the code that creates the ourAnimals array data used by the app. However, since some information is not available when a pet's data is first entered, you need to build the features that are used to ensure a complete dataset exists for each animal. You have volunteered to develop an initial version of the new features.

## What will we be doing?

This module challenges you to develop features of the Contoso Pets application.

In short, you need to:

- develop the feature that ensures animal ages and physical descriptions are complete
- develop the feature that ensures animal nickname and personality descriptions are complete

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you'll have an updated version of the Contoso Pets application that is able to ensure every pet in the ourAnimals array has a complete dataset.
