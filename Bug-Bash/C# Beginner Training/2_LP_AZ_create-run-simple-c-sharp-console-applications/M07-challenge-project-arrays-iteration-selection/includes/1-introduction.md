End users often ask developers to create new features for an existing application. Often times this is an indication that the application is being used and that the customer plans to continue using it in the future, hopefully with what they feel are improved features. The ability to update an existing application based on user requests is very important. A successful update will preserve the integrity of the original application while providing the user with the improved experience that they requested.

## Example scenario

Suppose you're a teacher's assistant that has been working on an application to help automate the grading process. You've developed a version of the application that uses arrays to supply the application with data, and a combination of iteration and selection statements that fully automate the process of calculating and reporting student grades. Your application even differentiates between exam assignments and extra credit assignments when calculating student grades. It does everything that the teacher wanted. However, as is often the case when providing the customer with a useful application, you've received a request for additional features. The teacher has asked you to update the grading report to show exam and extra credit assignment scores separately from the final numeric score and letter grade.  

## What will we be doing?

This module challenges you to add new capabilities to your Student Grading application.

In short, you need to use the teacher's updated grading report specification to:

- update the iteration and selection code to calculate separate final scores for exams, extra credit assignments, and the overall grade.
- update the code that writes the grading report to the console.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you'll have an updated version of the Student Grading application that's able to calculate and report student grades in accordance with the teacher's updated requirements.
