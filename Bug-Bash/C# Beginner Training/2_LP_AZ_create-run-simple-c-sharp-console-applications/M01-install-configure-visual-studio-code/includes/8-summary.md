Our goal was to install and configure an integrated development environment that meets our coding requirements for C#

Installing Visual Studio Code was quick and easy, and a tour of the user interface demonstrated a logical layout that is consistent with industry standards. We were able to configure extensions that make Visual Studio Code an even more powerful tool for C# code development. We also installed the .NET SDK to provide .NET Class Library support and support for .NET command line interface commands.  

You are now fully prepared to create great C# applications in a coding environment used by professional developers worldwide.
