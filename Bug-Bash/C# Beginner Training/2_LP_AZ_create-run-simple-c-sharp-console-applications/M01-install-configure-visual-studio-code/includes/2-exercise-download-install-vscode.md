Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.js and has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages and runtimes (such as C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, Go, .NET).

## Download Visual Studio Code

Getting up and running with Visual Studio Code is quick and easy. It is a small download so you can install in a matter of minutes.

1. Open a new browser window, and then navigate to: [https://code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com).

    You can use any browser that you want, such as the Microsoft Edge browser or the Chrome browser.

1. In the browser window, click **Download for Windows**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you are working in an environment that's running macOS or Linux, use the down-arrow icon to the right of **Download for Windows** to select the appropriate installer file.
  
1. Wait for the installation file to finish downloading.

    The installation file (for a Windows PC) has a name that is similar to the following: VSCodeUserSetup-x64-1.72.2.exe

    > [!NOTE]
    > The file name depends on the current version of Visual Studio Code and your computer’s operating system.

## Install Visual Studio Code

VS Code is lightweight and should run on most available hardware and platform versions. You can review the [System Requirements](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/requirements) to check if your computer configuration is supported.

1. On your PC, open a file explorer app, and then navigate to your computer’s downloads folder.

    On a Windows PC, use File Explorer to open your Downloads folder.

1. In your file explorer app, select and run the Visual Studio Code installation file.

    On a Windows PC, you can double-click the installation file to begin the installation process. For example, double-click **VSCodeUserSetup-x64-1.72.2**

    After a moment, the **Setup - Microsoft Visual Studio Code** dialog window will appear.

1. On the **License Agreement** page, to accept the license terms, click **I accept the agreement**, and then click **Next**.

    The **License Agreement** page is the initial page displayed when the **Setup - Microsoft Visual Studio Code** dialog first opens. You will be guided through the installation process. We recommend accepting the default settings in most cases, but you have the opportunity to customize the installation to meet your requirements.

1. On the **Select Destination Location** page, to accept the default installation folder, click **Next**.

    You may have noticed that the installation only requires about 300MB of hard disk space.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Although you have the option to specify a different installation folder, we recommend accepting the default location.

1. On the **Select Start Menu Folder** page, to accept the default folder, click **Next**.

1. On the **Select Additional Tasks** page, under **Other:**, ensure that the following options are selected:

    - **Add "Open with Code" action to the Windows Explorer file context menu**

    - **Add "Open with Code" action to the Windows Explorer directory context menu**

    - **Register Code as as editor for supported file types**

    - **Add to PATH (requires shell restart)**

    Although the first two options are certainly not required, you may find it helpful to be able to open files or folders in Visual Studio Code from File Explorer.

1. On the **Select Additional Tasks** page, click **Next**.

1. On the **Ready to Install** page, click **Install**.

    The installation process is pretty quick, and a progress bar is displayed during installation so that you can see the status. Installation should be complete after 15 or 20 seconds.

1. On the **Completing the Visual Studio Code Setup Wizard** page, deselect **Launch Visual Studio Code**.

    For now we just want to complete the installation. Don't worry, you will be opening Visual Studio Code in the next exercise.

1. On the **Completing the Visual Studio Code Setup Wizard** page, to complete the installation without launching Visual Studio Code, click **Finish**.

Congratulations, you've installed Visual Studio Code and are ready to start exploring this great integrated development environment!
