Try to imagine a software application that doesn't use data. It likely that every software application you will create or use works with data. In completing this coding project you will apply your C# data knowledge and skills in:

- Choosing the correct data types and safely converting data types.
- Manipulating number, string and character arrays, as well as adding, removing, and sorting data.
- Modifying and building complex strings from multiple data sources, and formatting data for display across regions.

As the complexity of your applications grow, it becomes even more important to review your code and ensure that your variables are scoped at an appropriate level. Therefore, to achieve the design goals of your application, you'll need to mix and combine all the programming skills that you have learned.

## Example scenario

Suppose you're a developer who likes to support the local community. You and some of your friends started a business that helps find new homes for stray or abandoned cats and dogs. Your business started off small, with just a couple of animals, but it is starting to grow. Your friends have an initial application developed that enables the entry and display of the the animals available for adoption. They ask you to investigate adding to features to the app that could help to match the animals in your care with people who are looking for a new family pet. They have found that it's important to search the pet data identify animals with possible matches based on characteristics provided by potential owners.

Further, the team wants to include a fundraising feature to include a suggested donation data and to present the pet data with fewer lines of output.

## What will we be doing?

This module guides you through the process of developing basic features of the Contoso Pets application. You are provided with code that produces sample data, and list the descriptions of the animals in your care. The starting app also provides a working menu to choose to list the animals available or to search search either dogs or cats with placeholder "coming soon" text. You will implement a basic search that uses a single search term, you will use variables and expressions to direct the execution of your code through the branches that you've developed. You will also work to ensure that variables are scoped appropriately.

You are provided with a starting application that will:

- Add predefined *sample* data to the pets array
- Iterate "menu options and user selection" code block to establish the outer loop of your application
- Implement code branches corresponding to the user's menu selections
- Display all the information contained in the array used to store pet data

Your basic task is implementing a search feature that will:

- Gather the pet characteristic search term input
- Loop through the animals array and identify "dogs"
- For each dog, search the description for a term match
- Track and display the dogs that have a term match

Beyond the search feature, the team asked that you add a `suggestedDonation` field and for an update of the feature that lists current pet information to include `suggestedDonation`.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you will be able to develop code that combines iteration statements with data input, data processing, string indexing, and data output functionality to implement search functionality.

You will also make updates to existing code to add a `suggestedDonation` data and display all data in a shortened format.
