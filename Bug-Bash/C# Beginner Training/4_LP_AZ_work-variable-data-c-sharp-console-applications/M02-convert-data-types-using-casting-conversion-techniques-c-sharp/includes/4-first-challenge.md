Code challenges throughout these modules will reinforce what you've learned and help you gain some confidence before continuing.

## First challenge

This module will feature two code challenges. This first challenge forces you to split up the data depending on its type and either concatenate or add the data accordingly.

### Step 1: Delete or comment out all of the code from the earlier exercise.

Select and delete all code lines in the Visual Studio Code Editor. Optionally, use the line comment operator `//` to comment out all of the code from the previous step.

### Step 2: Write code to implement the business rules.

1. Iterate through each value in a string of values. Start with the following line of code.

    ```c#
    string[] values = { "12.3", "45", "ABC", "11", "DEF" };
    ```

2. Add all the code necessary to implement the following business rules:

    - Rule 1: If the value is alphanumeric, concatenate it to form a message.
    - Rule 2: If the value is numeric, add it to the total.
    - Rule 3: Make sure the result matches the following output:

        ```Output
        Message: ABCDEF
        Total: 68.3
        ```
