title: Exercise - Explore data type casting and conversion
durationInMinutes: 30
---

There are multiple techniques to perform a data type conversion or cast. Which technique you choose depends on your answer to two important questions:

- Is it possible, depending on the value, that attempting to change the value's data type would throw an exception at run time?
- Is it possible, depending on the value, that attempting to change the value's data type would result in a loss of information?

In this exercise, we'll work our way through these questions, the implications of their answers, and which technique you should use when you need to change the data type.

### Prepare your coding environment

This module includes hands-on activities that guide you through the process of building and running demonstration code. We encourage you to complete these activities using Visual Studio Code as your development environment. Using Visual Studio Code for these activities will help you to become more comfortable writing and running code in a developer environment that's used by professionals worldwide.

1. Open Visual Studio Code.

    You can use the Windows Start menu (or equivalent resource for another OS) to open Visual Studio Code.

1. On the Visual Studio Code **File** menu, select **Open Folder**.

1. In the **Open Folder** dialog, navigate to the Windows Desktop folder.

    If you have different folder location where you keep code projects, you can use that folder location instead. For this training, the important thing is to have a location thatâ€™s easy locate and remember.

1. In the **Open Folder** dialog, select **Select Folder**.

    If you see a security dialog asking if you trust the authors, select **Yes**.

1. On the Visual Studio Code **Terminal** menu, select **New Terminal**.

    Notice that a command prompt in the Terminal panel displays the folder path for the current folder. For example:  

    ```dos
    C:\Users\someuser\Desktop>
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you are working on your own PC rather than in a sandbox or hosted environment and you have completed other Microsoft Learn modules in this C# series, you may have already created a project folder for code samples. If that's the case, you can skip over the next step, which is used to create a console app in the TestProject folder.

1. To create a new console application in a specified folder, at the Terminal command prompt type: **`dotnet new console -o ./CsharpProjects/TestProject`** and then press Enter.

    This .NET CLI command uses a .NET program template to create a new C# console application project in the specified folder location. The command creates the CsharpProjects and TestProject folders for us, and uses TestProject as the name of our `.csproj` file.

1. In the EXPLORER panel, expand the **CsharpProjects** folder.

    You should see the TestProject folder and two files, a C# program file named Program.cs and a C# project file named TestProject.csproj.

1. In the EXPLORER panel, to view your code file in the Editor panel, select **Program.cs**.

1. Delete the existing code lines.

    You'll be using this C# console project to create, build, and run code samples during this module.

1. Close the Terminal panel.

## Question: Is it possible that attempting to change the value's data type would throw an exception at run time?

The C# compiler will try to accommodate your code, but will always avoid an operation that could result in an exception. When you understand the C# compiler's primary concern, understanding why it functions a certain way will be easier.

### Step 1 - Write code that attempts to add an int and a string and save the result in an int

1. Ensure that you have Visual Studio Code open and Program.cs displayed in the Editor panel.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Program.cs should be empty. If if isn't, select and delete all code lines.

1. Type the following code into the Visual Studio Code Editor:

    ```c#
    int first = 2;
    string second = "4";
    int result = first + second;
    Console.WriteLine(result);
    ```

    Here, we're attempting to add the values `2` and `4`. The value `4` is of type `string`. Will this work?

1. On the Visual Studio Code **File** menu, select **Save**.

    The Program.cs file must be saved before building or running the code.

1. In the EXPLORER panel, to open a Terminal at your TestProject folder location, right-click **TestProject**, and then select **Open in Integrated Terminal**.

    A Terminal panel should open, and should include a command prompt showing that the Terminal is open to your TestProject folder location.

1. At the Terminal command prompt, to run your code, type **`dotnet run`** and then press Enter.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you see a message saying "Couldn't find a project to run", ensure that the Terminal command prompt displays the expected TestProject folder location. For example: `C:\Users\someuser\Desktop\csharpprojects\TestProject>`

    You should see the following approximate output

    ```Output
    C:\Users\someuser\Desktop\csharpprojects\TestProject\Program.cs(3,14): error CS0029: Cannot implicitly convert type 'string' to 'int'
    ```

1. The important part of the error message, **`(3,14): error CS0029: Cannot implicitly convert type 'string' to 'int'`**, tells us the problem is with our use of the `string` data type. But why can't the C# Compiler just handle this? After all, we can do the *opposite* to concatenate a number to a `string` and save it in a string variable. Here, we'll merely change the data type of the `result` variable from `int` to `string`. Update your code in the Visual Studio Code Editor as follows:

    ```c#
    int first = 2;
    string second = "4";
    string result = first + second;
    Console.WriteLine(result);
    ```

1. Save your code file, and then use Visual Studio Code to run your code. This will produce the following output:

    ```Output
    24
    ```

The output is mathematically incorrect but completes by combining the values as the characters "2" and "4".

Let's return to our first code example where the `result` variable is of type `int`. Why can't the C# compiler figure out that we want to treat the variable `second` containing `4` as a number, not a `string`?

The C# compiler sees a potential problem in the making. The variable `second` is of type `string`, so it might be set to a different value like `"hello"`. If the C# compiler attempted to convert `"hello"` to a number that would cause an exception at runtime. To avoid this possibility, the C# compiler will not implicitly perform the conversion from `string` to `int` for you.

From the C# compiler's perspective, the safer operation would be to convert `int` into a `string` and perform concatenation instead.

If you intend to perform addition using a string, the C# compiler requires you to take more explicit control of the process of data conversion. In other words, it forces you to be more involved so that you can put the proper precautions in place to handle the possibility that the conversion could throw an exception.

If you need to change a value from the original data type to a new data type and the change could produce an exception at run time, you must perform a **data conversion**.

To perform data conversion, you can use one of several techniques:

- Use a helper method on the data type
- Use a helper method on the variable
- Use the Convert class' methods

We'll look at a few examples of these techniques for data conversion later in this unit.

## Question: Is it possible that attempting to change the value's data type would result in a loss of information?

The term *widening conversion* means that you are attempting to convert a value **from** a data type that could hold *less* information **to** a data type that can hold *more* information. In this case, you'll lose no information. So, an example of this would be converting a value stored in a variable of type `int` and now converting that value into a variable of type `decimal`.

If you were to print out the two values, you would likely notice no difference.

When you know you'll be performing a widening conversion, you can rely on **implicit conversion**. Implicit conversion is handled by the compiler.

### Step 2 - Modify the code in the to perform an implicit conversion

1. Delete or use the line comment operator `//` to comment out the code from the previous exercise step, and add the following code:

    ```c#
    int myInt = 3;
    Console.WriteLine($"int: {myInt}");

    decimal myDecimal = myInt;
    Console.WriteLine($"decimal: {myDecimal}");
    ```

1. Save your code file, and then use Visual Studio Code to run your code. When you run the code, you should see the following output:

    ```Output
    int: 3
    decimal: 3
    ```

The key to this example is this line of code:

```c#
decimal myDecimal = myInt;
```

Since any `int` value can easily fit inside of a `decimal`, the compiler performs the conversion.

The term **narrowing conversion** means that you're attempting to convert a value from a data type that can hold more information to a data type that can hold less information. In this case, you may lose information such as precision (that is, the number of values after the decimal point). An example of this would be converting value stored in a variable of type `decimal` and now convert that value into a variable of type `int`. If you were to print out the two values, you would possibly notice the loss of information.

When you know you'll be performing a narrowing conversion, you'll need to perform a **cast**. Casting is an instruction to the C# compiler that you know precision may be lost, but you're willing to accept it.

### Step 3 - Modify the code in the .NET Editor to perform a cast

To perform a cast, you use the casting operator `()` to surround a data type, then place it next to the variable you want to convert.

1. Delete or use the line comment operator `//` to comment out the code from the previous exercise step, and add the following code:

    ```c#
    decimal myDecimal = 3.14m;
    Console.WriteLine($"decimal: {myDecimal}");

    int myInt = (int)myDecimal;
    Console.WriteLine($"int: {myInt}");
    ```

1. Save your code file, and then use Visual Studio Code to run your code. When you run the code, you should see the following output:

    ```Output
    decimal: 3.14
    int: 3
    ```

The key to this example is this line of code:

```c#
int myInt = (int)myDecimal;
```

The variable `myDecimal` holds a value that has precision after the decimal point. By adding the casting instruction `(int)`, we're telling the C# compiler that we understand it's possible we'll lose that precision, and in this situation, it's fine.

## How do I know if a conversion is a "widening conversion" or a "narrowing conversion"?

If you're not sure whether you'll lose data or not, you can write code to perform a conversion in two different ways and observe the changes. Developers frequently write small tests to better understand the behaviors, as illustrated with the next sample.

1. Delete or use the line comment operator `//` to comment out the code from the previous exercise step, and add the following code:

    ```c#
    decimal myDecimal = 1.23456789m;
    float myFloat = (float)myDecimal;
    
    Console.WriteLine($"Decimal: {myDecimal}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Float  : {myFloat}");
    ```

1. Save your code file, and then use Visual Studio Code to run your code. When you run the code, you should see the following output:

    ```Output
    Decimal: 1.23456789
    Float:   1.234568
    ```

From this, I can see that casting a `decimal` into a `float` is a narrowing conversion because I'm losing precision.

## Performing Data Conversions

Earlier, we said that when you need to change a value from one data type into another, and that change could cause a runtime exception, you should perform data conversion, and there are three techniques you can use:

- Use a helper method on the variable
- Use a helper method on the data type
- Use the Convert class' methods

### Use ToString() to convert a number to a string

Every data type variable has a `ToString()` method. What the `ToString()` method does depends on how it's implemented on a given type. However, on most primitives, it performs a widening conversion. While this isn't strictly necessary (since we can rely on implicit conversion in most cases) it can communicate to other developers that you understand what you're doing and it's intentional.

### Step 4 - Modify the code in the .NET Editor to convert a number to a string using the ToString() helper method

Here's a quick example of using the `ToString()` method to explicitly convert `int` values into `string`s.

1. Delete or use the line comment operator `//` to comment out the code from the previous exercise step, and add the following code:

    ```c#
    int first = 5;
    int second = 7;
    string message = first.ToString() + second.ToString();
    Console.WriteLine(message);
    ```

1. Save your code file, and then use Visual Studio Code to run your code. When you run the code, you should see the following output -- a concatenation of the two values:

    ```Output
    57
    ```

## Explicitly converting a string to a number

Most of the numeric data types have a `Parse()` method, which will convert a string into the given data type. In this case, we'll use the `Parse()` method to convert two strings into `int` values, then add them together.

### Step 5 - Modify the code in the .NET Editor to convert a string to an int using the Parse() helper method

1. Delete or use the line comment operator `//` to comment out the code from the previous exercise step, and add the following code:

    ```c#
    string first = "5";
    string second = "7";
    int sum = int.Parse(first) + int.Parse(second);
    Console.WriteLine(sum);
    ```

1. Save your code file, and then use Visual Studio Code to run your code. When you run the code, you should see the following output -- a concatenation of the two values:

    ```Output
    12
    ```

Can you spot the potential problem with the code example above? What if either of the variables `first` or `second` are set to values that can't be converted to an `int`? An exception will be thrown at runtime. This is exactly what the C# compiler and runtime expects us to plan for ahead of time. Fortunately, we can mitigate this in several ways.

The easiest way to mitigate this situation is through the use of `TryParse()`, which is a better version of the `Parse()` method. We'll discover that in the next unit.

## Data Conversion using the Convert class

The Convert class has many helper methods to convert a value from one type into another. In the following code example, we'll convert a couple of strings into values of type `int`.

## Step 6 - Modify the code in the .NET Editor to convert a string to a number using the Convert class

1. Delete or use the line comment operator `//` to comment out the code from the previous exercise step, and add the following code:

    ```c#
    string value1 = "5";
    string value2 = "7";
    int result = Convert.ToInt32(value1) * Convert.ToInt32(value2);
    Console.WriteLine(result);
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> Why is the method name `ToInt32()`? Why not `ToInt()`? `System.Int32` is the name of the underlying data type in the .NET Class Library that the C# programming language maps to the keyword `int`. Because the `Convert` class is also part of the .NET Class Library, it is called by its full name, not its C# name. By defining data types as part of the .NET Class Library, multiple .NET languages like Visual Basic, F#, IronPython, and others can share the same data types and the same classes in the .NET Class Library. At the end of this module, we'll post some links so you can learn more about .NET's Common Type System.

The `ToInt32()` method has 19 overloaded versions allowing it to accept virtually every data type as we'll see in a moment.

We used the `Convert.ToInt32()` method with a string here, but you should probably use `TryParse()` when possible.

So, when should we use the `Convert` class? The Convert class is best for converting fractional numbers into whole numbers (`int`) because it rounds up the way you would expect.

### Casting versus Conversion

The following example demonstrates what happens when you attempt to cast a `decimal` into an `int` (a narrowing conversion) versus using the `Convert.ToInt32()` method to convert the same `decimal` into an `int`.

## Step 7 - Modify the code in the .NET Editor to compare casting and converting a decimal into an int

1. Delete or use the line comment operator `//` to comment out the code from the previous exercise step, and add the following code:

    ```c#
    int value = (int)1.5m; // casting truncates
    Console.WriteLine(value);

    int value2 = Convert.ToInt32(1.5m); // converting rounds up
    Console.WriteLine(value2);
    ```

1. Save your code file, and then use Visual Studio Code to run your code. When you run the code, you should see the following output -- a concatenation of the two values:

    ```Output
    1
    2
    ```

### Casting truncates

When casting `int value = (int)1.5m;`, the value of the float is truncated so the result is `1`, meaning the value after the decimal is ignored completely. We could change the literal float to `1.999m` and the result of casting would be the same.

### Converting rounds

When converting using `Convert.ToInt32()`, the literal float value is properly rounded up to `2`. If we changed the literal value to `1.499m`, it would be rounded down to `1`.

## Recap

We covered several important concepts of data conversion and casting:

- Perform a data conversion when it's possible that doing so could cause a runtime error.
- Perform an explicit cast to tell the compiler you understand the risk of losing data.
- Rely on the compiler to perform an implicit cast when performing an expanding conversion.
- Use the () cast operator and the data type to perform a cast (for example, `(int)myDecimal`).
- Use the `Convert` class when you want to perform a narrowing conversion, but want to perform rounding, not a truncation of information.

## Check your knowledge

## Multiple Choice

Which is the best technique to convert a decimal type to an int type in C#?
(x) cast {{That's correct. `decimal` to `int` is a narrowing conversion so `cast` is the best answer.}}
( ) narrowing {{Thatâ€™s incorrect. "Narrowing" describes the data precision change in a conversion.}}
( ) implicit conversion {{Thatâ€™s incorrect. `decimal` to `int` is a narrowing conversion and implicit conversion cannot be used because data loss is possible.}}

## Multiple Choice

Which conversion below will round the value (verses truncate)?
( ) `int cost = (int)3.75m;` {{Thatâ€™s incorrect. Casting truncates all decimals.}}
(x) `int cost = Convert.ToInt32(3.75m);` {{Thatâ€™s correct. `Convert.ToInt32()` will round values with fractional precision}}
( ) `uint cost = (uint)3.75m;` {{Thatâ€™s incorrect. Casting truncates all decimals.}}
