# Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador Bug Bashes - Submitting Product Feedback
Welcome to the GitHub repository for [Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador](http://studentambassadors.microsoft.com/) Bug Bashes and product feedback activities. This GitHub repo contains the instructions for how to participate in the Bug Bashes as well as the space to report any feedback or issues discovered.

## How do I get started?üìÑ
We're currently focusing on C# Beginner Content as a follow up from the [.NET Conf Student Zone](https://github.com/microsoft/dotnetconf-studentzone)! Your feedback will ensure a good learner experience in the initial release of these Learning Paths and help the team gauge the instruction level that's required to ensure learners are successful.

1. **Navigate to the four different Learning Paths under [C# Beginner Training](https://github.com/microsoft/studentambassadors/tree/main/Bug-Bash/C%23%20Beginner%20Training) and complete the modules in the 'includes' folder.**  While completing the modules, try to find as many bugs as possible (e.g., What is confusing about the language used in the instructions? What issues/errors are you encountering?).
2. **[Create an issue](https://github.com/microsoft/studentambassadors/issues) on this repository for each new issue you want to report.** Choose the "üêûReport a Bug!" option when creating a new issue. Make sure to review the issues that others have already reported to ensure you're not reporting something duplicative.

**Learning Path order:**
1. [Get Started with C#](https://github.com/microsoft/studentambassadors/tree/main/Bug-Bash/C%23%20Beginner%20Training/1_LP_AZ_get-started-with-c-sharp)
2.	[Create and run simple C# console applications](https://github.com/microsoft/studentambassadors/tree/main/Bug-Bash/C%23%20Beginner%20Training/2_LP_AZ_create-run-simple-c-sharp-console-applications)
3.	[Add logic to C# console applications](https://github.com/microsoft/studentambassadors/tree/main/Bug-Bash/C%23%20Beginner%20Training/3_LP_AZ_add-logic-c-sharp-console-applications)
4.	[Work with variable data in C# console applications](https://github.com/microsoft/studentambassadors/tree/main/Bug-Bash/C%23%20Beginner%20Training/4_LP_AZ_work-variable-data-c-sharp-console-applications)


**How do I win a mentorship session?**

- For every issue [issue](https://github.com/microsoft/studentambassadors/issues) you report, you will get 1 entry into a raffle to win a mentorship session.

## What is a Bug Bash? üïµÔ∏è
A Bug Bash is a cross-team effort where everyone aims to find as many bugs as possible. A cross-functional team is important to test from a variety of perspectives and in different ways. 

We want to understand the following:
- How can we write the documentation and Learn modules better? What is helpful or confusing? What gaps exist in our documentation?
- What errors and issues are you encountering?

Our goal is to improve the readibility and usability of content and services for you. Even if you've reviewed these Learn modules and guides many times before or if you're seeing this for the first time, we want YOUR feedback! A diversity of perspectives is important to finding as many bugs as possible and making an improvement in your experience (and for other students like you).

## Why should I participate or provide feedback? ü§î
We've heard that you want to develop technical skills, help and empower others to learn and grow, support new Ambassadors, contribute to the community (perhaps in other ways than hosting an event), and gain industry exposure. Providing product feedback and reporting issues via this Bug Bash can help you do just that.

- Reviewing these materials will not only help you further develop your technical skills, but it will also provide a better learning experience for others.
- Participating in a Bug Bash and providing actionable product feedback will give you further insight into the typical activities of software development and product/program management. Additionally, your contributions in terms of feedback can be a great item to add to your resume with a clear story of what you did and the impact you had.
- For those that are interested in being nominated to the Gold milestone, we highly recommend you participate in Bug Bashes as your schedule allows. Collecting product feedback is important to the Student Ambassador program team and our Cloud Advocate partners, and we will consider quality, actionable feedback you provide in your nomination to the Gold milestone.
- Help us understand how we should continue to run Bug Bashes in the future! Participate in this pilot to help us determine additional, effective ways to allow you the opportunity to provide us with product feedback and get exposure to the process and the product teams we work with to resolve outstanding issues.


## Tips for Providing Feedback üêû
When you encounter a challenge, issue or bug, consider the following when [logging your issue]((https://github.com/microsoft/studentambassadors/issues)):
- What issue/challenge did I encounter?
- What steps did I take to encounter this challenge/issue? How would I reproduce it?
- What is the outcome or behavior that I am expecting?
- Why is this an issue or challenge for you?
- How does it impact your activities/task at hand?
- What is your current workaround?

We recommend that you review the materials that you think less individuals will choose - it's a great way to find the bugs no one else has already found and increase your exposure opportunities with Microsoft.
