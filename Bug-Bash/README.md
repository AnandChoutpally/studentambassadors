# Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador Bug Bash
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the [Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador](http://studentambassadors.microsoft.com/) Bug Bash. This GitHub repo contains the instructions for the Bug Bash as well as the space to report issues discovered in the Bug Bash.

## Bug Bash InstructionsüìÑ
1. Review the materials on Azure Static Web Apps (including the modules and the quickstarts/tutorials) and try to find as many bugs as possible (e.g., What is confusing about the language used in the instructions? What issues/errors are you encountering?). The full list of materials to review is in the Bug Bash Materials section. 
2. [Create an issue](https://github.com/microsoft/studentambassadors/issues) on this repository for each new issue you want to report. Choose the "üêûReport a Bug!" option when creating a new issue. Make sure to review the issues that others have already reported to ensure you're reporting something duplicative.
3. [Sign up for our leaderboard](https://aka.ms/SACloudSkillsChallenge) to track your progress reviewing the selected Learn modules and see how everyone else is doing. Remember - the [issues logged here on GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/studentambassadors/issues) is what really counts for the Bug Bash, not just your module completion rate!

## What is a Bug Bash? üïµÔ∏è
A Bug Bash is a cross-team effort where everyone aims to find as many bugs as possible. A cross-functional team is important to test from a variety of perspectives and in different ways. 

For this Bug Bash, we'll be focusing on Azure Static Web Apps. We want to understand the following:
- How can we write the documentation and Learn modules better? What is helpful or confusing? What gaps exist in our documentation?
- What errors and issues are you encountering?

**Azure Static Web Apps is a modern web app service that offers streamlined full-stack development from source code to global high availability.**

Benefits of Static Web Apps include:

- Productivity from local development to GitHub native workflows for CI/CD
- Managed global availability for static content
- Dynamic scale for serverless APIs
- Streamlined management including custom domain configuration and authentication and authorization
- Seamless developer experience and CI/CD
- Tailored developer experience that includes a Visual Studio Code extension

Our goal is to improve the readibility and usability of this content and the Azure Static Web Apps service for you. Even if you've reviewed these Learn modules and guides many times before or if you're seeing this for the first time, we want YOUR feedback! A diversity of perspectives is important to finding as many bugs as possible and making an improvement in your experience (and for other students like you).

## Why should I participate? ü§î
We've heard that you want to develop technical skills, help and empower others to learn and grow, support new Ambassadors, contribute to the community (perhaps in other ways than hosting an event), and gain industry exposure. Providing product feedback and reporting issues via this Bug Bash can help you do just that.

- Reviewing these materials will not only help you further develop your technical skills, but it will also provide a better learning experience for others. Azure Static Web Apps is, and will continue to be, a large part of our [technical onboarding](https://github.com/microsoft/SATechnicalOnboarding/blob/main/technical-onboarding-instructions.md) to the Ambassadors commmunity, and this feedback will improve that learning experience for others. For those that have not yet completed the [technical onboarding](https://github.com/microsoft/SATechnicalOnboarding/blob/main/technical-onboarding-instructions.md), this is a great way to get most of that completed while also making a contribution to the community.
- Participating in a Bug Bash and providing actionable product feedback will give you further insight into the typical activities of software development and product/program management. Additionally, your contributions in terms of feedback can be a great item to add to your resume with a clear story of what you did and the impact you had.
- For those that are interested in being nominated to the Gold milestone, we highly recommend you participate in Bug Bashes as your schedule allows. Collecting product feedback is important to the Student Ambassador program team and our Cloud Advocate partners, and we will consider quality, actionable feedback you provide in your nomination to the Gold milestone.
- Help us understand how we should continue to run Bug Bashes in the future! Participate in this pilot to help us determine additional, effective ways to allow you the opportunity to provide us with product feedback and get exposure to the process and the product teams we work with to resolve outstanding issues.


## Tips for Providing Feedback üêû
When you encounter a challenge, issue or bug, consider the following when [logging your issue]((https://github.com/microsoft/studentambassadors/issues)):
- What issue/challenge did I encounter?
- What steps did I take to encounter this challenge/issue? How would I reproduce it?
- What is the outcome or behavior that I am expecting?
- Why is this an issue or challenge for you?
- How does it impact your activities/task at hand?
- What is your current workaround?

We recommend that you review the materials that you think less individuals will choose - it's a great way to find the bugs no one else has already found and increase your exposure opportunities with Microsoft.

Good luck bug bashing!
